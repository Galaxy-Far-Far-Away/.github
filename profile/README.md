## Enable secure development at scale

Nullify is your automated security sentry that continuously finds and fixes security issues across your codebase from commit to merge.

### üõ°Ô∏è Continuous Security Monitoring
Nullify integrates seamlessly into your existing version control workflows, ensuring security checks are performed on all code changes. This integration allows for continuous security monitoring and reduces the burden on both security and development teams.

### ‚ö° AI-Enhanced Remediation
Nullify leverages OpenAI to provide developers with contextual and actionable security feedback directly within their version control environment. Recommended in-line fixes and best practices help engineers write secure code from the start, without compromising developer experience.

### üöÄ Risk Prioritization
Prioritize and fix only the vulnerabilities that need fixing. Nullify employs an intelligent risk prioritization mechanism, categorizing security issues based on severity and exploitability. This ensures that your team focuses on addressing the most critical vulnerabilities promptly.

### üìà Organization-Wide Metrics 
Ship metrics and insights to measure adoption and coverage via your dashboard platform of choice, and gain visibility into your application security posture at any given point in time.
